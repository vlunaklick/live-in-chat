> In this project I created a 'Realtime chat'. It was created using Next.js in the frontend and Express in the backend. Also, I had to create another server where I deployed the socket.io server, this was very important because it let me make the comunication client-server.

### Frontend

- React: Javascript library to create interfaces.
- Next.js: React framework that gives functionalities as SSR.
- üíÖ¬†styled-components: CSS-in-JS library for styling.
- react-icons: npm package with React-ready icon libraries.
- axios: HTTP client to request data from the backend.
- cookies-next: library to make cookies.
- socket.io-client: library to make the connection with the backend.
- react-toastify: library for notifications.

### Backend

- Node & Express: Javascript based stack for server applications.
- Prisma: ORM to interact with the database.
- PostgreSQL: A relational database was required by the challenge.
- socket.io: library for realtime web applications.
